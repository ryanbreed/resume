overview: Seasoned professional with 22 years of deep technical experience in security operations, architecture, monitoring, incident response, application security, and penetration testing. I have a keen interest in practical applications of large-scale data analysis, automation, and organizational resilience. I also have practical experience developing cooperative intelligence sharing partnerships with both public and private sector entities.

    text: |
      I have deep experience in an endpoint security role as an architect, incident responder, operator, and engineer. I have deployed multiple iterations of endpoint security technologies including application whitelisting, full disk encryption, antivirus, and EDR (enterprise detection and response). I have done this work in physical endpoints, virtual desktops, and virtualized (streaming) applications.
      Endpoint security is a high-visibility/high-contact control surface, and as such, I have had direct involvement in planning communications and support strategies to minimize risks from disrupting users' primary work environment.

      I have over a decade of data-intensive analytical experience in real time cyber security operations and Digital Forensics/Incident Response. Throughout that time, I have both leveraged and built large-scale data processing pipelines to generate insights and maintain situation awareness for both the real-time and historical analytical frames. I have undertaken many data integration projects to combine data sources from heterogeneous vendor platforms when there has been substantial business value to be gained. Finally, as a testament to my interest and determination, I have developed novel analytical techniques based on domain knowledge using a variety of traditional, statistical, and machine-learning approaches. Some samples of this work are available in my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
      I also have a strong track record of building performant systems that can scale with workload and operate reliably in hostile networks. I focus on resilient outcomes across all lifecycle stages in environments where technologies and threats change on much tighter loops than release schedules (or production deployments). My background performing penetration tests and security assessments across several industry verticals has informed both my philosophy for building systems as well as my values for making tradeoffs when the need arises.
